# Cplusplus_Graphical_Maze_Solver
Solves graphical mazes. Please see "Final Programming Assignment.pdf" for details about the implementation. See Maze.txt for an example maze. The maze that was solved for the final project was 64x64, and the BFS algorithm finds the most optimal path.

If you'd like to reproduce the results, run this program at the command line and insert the file names of the three mazes I've included as examples.

Enjoy!
